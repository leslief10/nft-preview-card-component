## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Image Hover Overlay is harder than it looks like. I'll experiment a bit with transitions/transformations to learn a bit more.

### Continued development

At some point in the future I'll come back to this challenge to correct the color of the svg I used for the overlay. I tried with the filter property, but I only got it to look black.
